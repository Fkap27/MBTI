                <h3><a name="CognitiveFunctions"></a>Cognitive Functions</h3>
                <p>Dominant: Extraverted Intuition (Ne) - This being their dominant and perceiving function, ENTPs perceive things in a very abstract manner and see the bigger picture as they can take information very quickly, consider many possibilities and think outside the box. Being able to make multiple connections whether they are related or unrelated. Essentially being able to brainstorm aloud, bring about innovation with their creative minds, and look at things from multiple angles and perspectives. This can also make them seem rambly and jump from tangent to another and often take longer for them to form conclusions and have an overall point.</p>
                <p>Auxiliary: Introverted Thinking (Ti) - Being their judging function, this enables ENTPs to have a thorough understanding of how something works. Allowing them to be logical and objective, filtering out emotional biases. Often aiding their sporadic pursuits and interests fueling their curiosity, this helps their own inner logical frameworks with their Ne and make sense of their often seemingly unrelated or even nonsensical ideas. Seeking accuracy for the information they gather to the extent they are interested in. They operate on their own inner subjective logic as for them, objective data are built on a subjective foundation. Which can make them quite blunt, playful, and nonchalant with their delivery. And play devilâ€™s advocate.</p>
                <p>Tertiary: Extraverted Feeling (Fe) - This judging function is concerned about maintaining social harmony. Whilst ENTPs are less likely to be disturbed or sensitive to external disharmony given their higher functions, they will still be able to maintain social harmony. Given that it is their tertiary function, this means that they are more likely to express their ideas and bounce off other people within conversations. This also enables them to be quite accommodating to others with their flexible nature and be smooth in social situations as they will know how to play the social game. Although, given that their Ti is higher, it can also make them prone to being blunt and such.</p>
                <p>Inferior: Introverted Sensing (Si) - This perceiving function provides stability and structure to the sensory information being perceived. Typically using the past for future application. With this being their inferior function, ENTPs will naturally struggle with this given the nature of Ne as they dislike feeling so limited with rigid structures, routines, plannings and being very traditional and conservative as they prefer to be very flexible, liberal, and unorthodox. Making them quite rebellious in nature. In turn, this can make them quite oblivious to the details of concrete daily life and not be consistent with their maintenance. However, healthy ENTPs can develop a balance with their Ne and Si by organising themselves physically and mentally that will be beneficial for them in the long run with a nice structure and coherency whilst still keeping their options open and flexible.</p>
                <h3><a name="Loop&Grip"></a>Loop & Grip</h3>
                <p>Healthy ENTPs are known for being imaginative, logical, spontaneous, and thinking outside the box. However, they can become unhealthy when they enter a Ne-Fe loop. Repressing their Ti and Fe. Being caught up in crazy ideas whilst being too easily swayed by other people and needing their approval. Being self-critical, more reckless, prone to emotional outbursts and appeasing other people without thorough thinking as they become less likely to trust their own logic.</p>
                <p>When ENTPs face extreme stress, they may start to experience an Si grip. They become much more reserved, self critical, paranoid, uninspired as they are obsessed with details, maintenance, and control. To help with this, they should be encouraged to relax, take things one step at a time, consider what truly matters to them, and allow them to be creative.</p>
