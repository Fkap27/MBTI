                <h3><a name="CognitiveFunctions"></a>Cognitive Functions</h3>
                <p>Dominant: Introverted Feeling (Fi) - Being their dominant and judging function, INFPs make decisions and judgements based on their own personal core values that are authentic to them. They determine their own sense of moral code based on what their gut instinct tells them is right and wrong. However, they also experience a great depth of emotions but are processed internally and have a tendency not to express them externally depending on the context and such and how much it aligns with their values. This means that they possess a great deal of compassion and empathy for others. But it can also mean that they can hold grudges. Valuing their individuality.</p>
                <p>Auxiliary: Extraverted Intuition (Ne) - Being their perceiving function, it enables INFPs to gather information in a very abstract manner. Making them very imaginative and consider many possibilities. In conjunction with their Fi, this enables them to explore their values and ideals in various ways. This can make them very open-minded and think outside the box but also take longer to arrive at conclusions with their values and what their place is in the world. It also makes them very idealistic and helps with their compassionate pursuits thinking about the bigger picture. Or even utilise it as a form of self-expression with creative outlets such as writing or art. Deriving different meanings and such from those mediums and the impressions it leaves them.</p>
                <p>Tertiary: Introverted Sensing (Si) - This function provides structure and stability for INFPs for their Ni within a more conservative manner to help balance out their spontaneous Ne. This means they will often use their past experience to help with future decisions and judgements. In conjunction with Fi, this will certainly help form their core personal values. It will provide more concrete to support their Ne which is more abstract. Enabling them to articulate well for their ideas and such. And making them creatures of habits and comfort despite their open-minded nature.</p>
                <p>Inferior: Extraverted Thinking (Te) - This judging function involves external, pragmatic analysis of what works, organisation, and productivity. However, given that it is their inferior function and it is opposite to their Fi, it can provide difficulty for INFPs. With them prioritising their own core personal values and such, it can make it difficult to be objective with some of their decision making as they will be more likely to think more with their hearts than their heads. Can be problematic when it comes to consistency on their productivity given their moods and implementing some of their ideals. Which can make them very harsh on themselves, feeling non-productive and incompetent. It also makes them pretty sensitive to criticism as they can see it as an attack on their character given their Fi .However, healthy INFPs can develop this function where they can still hold on to their values and make emotional judgments but also know when to be logical and objective.</p>
                <h3><a name="Loop&Grip"></a>Loop & Grip</h3>
                <p>Healthy INFPs are known for being authentic, idealistic, imaginative, and open-minded. However, they can become unhealthy when they enter a Fi-Si loop. Repressing their Ne and Te. Meaning that they will enter a cycle where they double down on their own core values that are primarily based on their own subjective experiences. Making them very stubborn and narrow-minded with their values as they will often catastrophise their negative experiences with their feelings without being open-minded and not holding them to any objective criteria.</p>
                <p>When INFPs are under extreme stress and such, they may start to experience an Te grip. Becoming less concerned with other peopleâ€™s feelings and less tactful as a result. Being more quick and rather impulsive both with their decision making for the need of accomplishing tasks as well as critiquing others for their competency. Often mulling over things and catastrophising it. To help them, give them time on their own and encourage them to have a more gentle and careful consideration for their approach and sort their thoughts.</p>
